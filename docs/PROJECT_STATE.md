# Project State

**Project:** Server Toolkit  
**Version:** 0.2.0-alpha  
**Status:** Active Implementation  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-04

## Purpose

This document is the single source of truth for the current implementation state of the Server Toolkit project.

It summarizes what is implemented, what is intentionally not implemented yet, and what should happen next.

This document must stay short, current, and factual.

---

## Current Phase

The project is in early Android feature implementation.

The current focus is stabilizing Server Inventory before starting SSH-related implementation.

---

- Room-backed Server repository implementation.
- Hilt database and DAO providers.
- Server Inventory repository dependency injection binding.
- Server Inventory ViewModel repository observation.
- Basic Server Inventory list rendering.
- Delete server UI action with confirmation dialog.
- Server Inventory ViewModel delete action.
- Manual delete flow verification after app restart.
- Server Inventory search by name, host, username, category, and tags.
- Server Inventory environment filtering.
- Server Inventory favorites-only filtering.
- Server Inventory filter clearing.
- Manual search and filtering verification.
- Automated search and filtering verification through unit tests, instrumented tests, and debug build.
- Automated Edit Server verification through unit tests, instrumented tests, and debug build.
- Automated shared Server Form naming verification through unit tests, instrumented tests, and debug build.
- Server Inventory stabilization checklist.
- Server Inventory filter matcher unit tests.
- DAO instrumentation tests for insert, replace, and delete behavior.
- Room-backed repository instrumentation tests for save, replace, and delete behavior.
- Server entity/domain mapper unit tests.
- Local persistence with Room architecture decision.
- Package structure cleanup from `feature/servers` to `feature/serverinventory`.
- Shared Add/Edit server form naming cleanup.
- App-level package structure alignment with the current source tree.

## Not Implemented Yet

The following items are intentionally not implemented yet:

- Room migration beyond database version 1.
- Migration tests.
- SSH connection workflow.
- Monitoring workflow.
- Command execution workflow.
- Xray or x-ui management workflow.
- Secure credential storage.

---

## In Progress

The current implementation area is:

- Server Inventory stabilization review.
- Confirmation that the 0.3.0 Server Inventory foundation is stable enough to support SSH workflows.
- Preservation of inventory management coverage before adding SSH or credential operations.

---

## Next Planned Work

The next safe development steps are:

1. Review `docs/SERVER_INVENTORY_STABILIZATION.md` against the implemented application behavior.
2. Decide whether the current Server Inventory foundation is ready to be treated as the 0.3.0 baseline.
3. Keep SSH and credential handling out of scope until inventory stabilization is explicitly accepted.

## Current Git Branch

```text
feature/android-project
```

---

## Current Engineering Rule

No SSH or credential handling should be introduced until Room-backed server inventory persistence and basic inventory management flows are tested and reviewed.
